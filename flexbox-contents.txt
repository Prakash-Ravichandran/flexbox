1. Flexbox aims at providing 

 a more efficient way to 
  
  * )lay out, 
  * )align  , 
  * )distribute space among items in a container - even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).

  Why  Flexbox ? 

  *) To give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes)

  * )  Flexbox is direction-agnostic  - as opposed to regular layouts ,,, block & inline works well for pages , but to support complex & large application they lag.


Note : Flexbox is for small scale layouts , while grid is for large complex layouts.
